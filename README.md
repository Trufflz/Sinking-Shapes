# Sinking-Shapes

My very first SFML Game that I created while watching Suraj Sharma's Youtube Videos. I created this game as a way to start learning the basics of Game Development in C++.

The user is faced off with shapes that fall down from the top of the screen. The goal is to click on as many shapes as you can to stop them from reaching the bottom of the screen.
Different enemies deal different amounts of damage, so its up to the user to gain as much points as they can before their health reaches 0.
